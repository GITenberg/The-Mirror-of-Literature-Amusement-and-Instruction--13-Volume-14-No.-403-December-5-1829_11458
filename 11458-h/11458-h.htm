      Fall of the Staubbath.

    <p>
      In the poet and the philosopher, the lover of the sublime,
      and the student of the beautiful in art&mdash;the
      contemplation of such a scene as this must awaken ecstatic
      feelings of admiration and awe. Its effect upon the mere man
      of the world, whose mind is clogged up with common-places of
      life, must be overwhelming as the torrent itself; perchance
      he soon recovers from the impression; but the lover of
      Nature, in her wonders, reads lessons of infinite wisdom,
      combined with all that is most fascinating to the mind of
      inquiring man. In the school of her philosophy, mountains,
      rivers, and falls not only astonish and delight him in their
      vast outlines and surfaces, but in their exhaustless
      varieties and transformations, he enjoys old and new worlds
      of knowledge, apart from the proud histories of man, and the
      comparative insignificance of all that he has laboured to
      produce on the face of the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few have witnessed the <i>Staubbach</i>, or similar wonders
      without acknowledging the force of their impressions. This
      Fall is in the valley of Lauterbrun, the most picturesque
      district of Switzerland. Simond,<a id="footnotetag1"
      name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
      in describing its beauties, says, "we began to ascend the
      valley of Lauterbrun, by the side of its torrent (the
      Lutschine) among fragments of rocks, torn from the heights on
      both sides, and beautiful trees, shooting up with great
      luxuriance and in infinite variety; smooth pastures of the
      richest verdure, carpeted over every interval of plain
      ground; and the harmony of the sonorous cow-bell of the Alps,
      heard among the precipices above our heads and below us, told
      us we were not in a desart." "The ruins of the mineral world,
      apparently so durable, and yet in a state of incessant
      decomposition, form a striking contrast with the perennial
      youth of the vegetable world; each individual plant, so frail
      and perishable, while the species is eternal in the existing
      economy of nature. Imperceptible forests of timber scarcely
      tinge their inert masses of gneiss and granite, into which
      they anchor their roots; grappling with substances which,
      when <span class="pagenum"><a id="page386"
      name="page386"></a>[pg 386]</span> struck with steel, tear up
      the tempered grain, and dash out the spark." This may be an
      enthusiastic, but is doubtless the faithful, impression of
      our tourist; and in descriptions of sublime nature, we should
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          Survey the whole; nor seek slight fault to find,
        </p>
        <p>
          Where Nature moves, and rapture warms the mind.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Each valley has its appropriate stream, proportioned to its
      length, and the number of lateral valleys opening into it.
      The boisterous Lutschine is the stream of Lauterbrun, and it
      carries to the Lake of Brientz scarcely less water than the
      Aar itself. About half way between Interlaken and Lauterbrun,
      is the junction of the two Lutschines, the black and the
      white, from the different substances with which they have
      been in contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simond says, "after passing several falls of water, each of
      which we mistook for the Staubbach, we came at last to the
      house where we were to sleep. It had taken us three hours to
      come thus far; in twenty minutes more we reached the heap of
      rubbish accumulated by degrees at the foot of the Staubbach;
      its waters descending from the height of the Pletschberg,
      form in their course several mighty cataracts, and the last
      but one is said to be the finest; but is not readily
      accessible, nor seen at all from the valley. The fall of the
      Staubbach, about <i>eight hundred feet in height</i>, wholly
      detached from the rock, is reduced into vapour long before it
      reaches the ground; the water and the vapour undulating
      through the air with more grace and elegance than sublimity.
      While amusing ourselves with watching the singular appearance
      of rockets of water shooting down into the dense cloud of
      vapour below, we were joined by some country girls, who gave
      us a concert of three voices, pitched excessively high, and
      more like the vibrations of metal or glass than the human
      voice, but in perfect harmony, and although painful in some
      degree, yet very fine. In winter an immense accumulation of
      ice takes place at the foot of the Fall, sometimes as much as
      three hundred feet broad, with two enormous icy stalactites
      hanging down over it. When heat returns, the falling waters
      hollow out cavernous channels through the mass, the effect of
      which is said to be very fine; this, no doubt, is the proper
      season to see the Staubbach to most advantage." Six or eight
      miles further, the valley ends in glaciers scarcely
      practicable for chamois hunters. About forty years since some
      miners who belonged to the Valais, and were at work at
      Lauterbrun, undertook to cross over to their own country,
      simply to hear mass on a Sunday. They traversed the level top
      of the glacier in three hours; then descended, amidst the
      greatest dangers, its broken slope into the Valais, and
      returned the day after by the same way; but no one else has
      since ventured on the dangerous enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from the romantic attraction of the Fall, the
      broad-eaved chalet and its accessaries form a truly
      interesting picture of village simplicity and repose. Here
      you are deemed rich with a capital of three hundred pounds.
      All that is not made in the country, or of its growth, is
      deemed luxury: a silver chain here as at Berne, is
      transmitted from mother to daughter. Dwellings and barns
      covered with tiles, and windows with large panes of glass,
      give to the owner a reputation of wealth; and if the outside
      walls are adorned with paintings, and passages of Scripture
      are inscribed on the front of the house, the owner ranks at
      once among the aristocracy of the country. What an
      association of primitive happiness do these humble attributes
      and characteristics of Swiss scenery convey to the
      unambitious mind. Think of this, ye who regard palaces as
      symbols of true enjoyment! and ye who imprison yourselves in
      overgrown cities, and wear the silken fetters of wealth and
      pride!&mdash;an aristocrat of Lauterbrun eclipses all your
      splendour, and a poor Swiss cottager in his humble chalet, is
      richer than the wealthiest of you&mdash;for he is
      <i>content</i>.

    <h3>
      PSALMODY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      In my paper of the 22nd of August, on this subject, I
      promised to resume it on my next coming to London, which has
      been retarded by several causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In visiting the Churches of All Souls, and Trinity, the
      psalmody is by no means to be praised. It is chiefly by the
      charity children, the singing (or rather noise) is in their
      usual way, and which will go on to the end of time, unless by
      the permission of the clergy, some intelligent instructors
      are allowed to lead as in the Chapel of St. James, near
      Mornington Place, in the Hampstead Road. The author of the
      paper on Music, in your publication of the 6th of September,
      very fairly puts the question, "Why are not the English a
      musical people?" and he shows many of
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page387" name="page387"></a>[pg
      387]</span> the interrupting causes. It may happen, however,
      that by cultivating psalmody in our churches and chapels,
      considerable progress may be made. The young will be
      instructed, and the more advanced will <i>attend</i>, and we
      know the power of <i>attention</i> (the only quality in which
      Sir Isaac Newton could be persuaded to believe he had any one
      advantage in intellect over his fellow men.)
    </p>
    <p>
      It is much to be regretted that the poetry in which our
      Episcopal Psalms and Hymns are sung, is confined to the
      versions of Sternhold and Hopkins, and of Tate and Brady. The
      poetry of Sternhold and Hopkins is in general uncouth with
      some few exceptions. Tate and Brady have made their
      versification somewhat more congenial with the modern
      improvements of our language; but each confines himself to
      the very literal language of the Old Testament; Sternhold and
      Hopkins in this respect have the advantage of their
      successors, Tate and Brady; for the translations of Sternhold
      and Hopkins are nearer to the original Hebrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main object of my hope is, that the version of the Psalms
      now in use may be altered, or rather improved, in such a
      manner as to manifest their prophetic and typical relation to
      Christianity, to which in their present form so little
      reference is to be perceived by those "who should read as
      they run." A change or improvement in this respect would give
      a more enlivening interest in Psalmody. Dr. Watts has done
      this with great truth and effect, and the singing in the
      churches and chapels in which his version is in whole or in
      part introduced, proceeds with a more Christian spirit: and a
      vast improvement has sprung from this source, in the sacred
      music of those churches and chapels.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate this part of my paper, let me refer to the
      version employed in several of the new churches, and to the
      version of Dr. Watts, in the spiritual interpretation of the
      4th Psalm. In the version first referred to, the words
      are&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          The place of ancient sacrifice
        </p>
        <p>
          Let <i>righteousness</i> supply,
        </p>
        <p>
          And let your hope securely fix'd
        </p>
        <p>
          On Him alone rely.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Now in this version it naturally occurs to inquire <i>what
      righteousness</i>? The high churchman will content himself
      that it is a literal translation; but the way-faring man sees
      nothing of the atoning righteousness of Christ in this
      translation; but which according to the 11th article of the
      Church of England, he reasonably looks for. Even the
      Unitarians refer to this and other parts of our translation
      of the Hebrew Psalms, as a justification of THEIR main
      principle of the unity alone in the godhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Watts, a genuine Christian, believing in the union of the
      Father, Son, and Spirit, and manifesting this pure faith to
      the end of a well-spent life, gives the Christian meaning of
      this righteousness, in his version of the 4th Psalm:
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          Know that the Lord divides his Saints
        </p>
        <p>
          From all the tribes of men beside,
        </p>
        <p>
          He hears the cry of penitents
        </p>
        <p>
          For the dear sake of Christ who died.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Here the true typical and prophetic meaning of the Old
      Testament is given.
    </p>
    <p>
      The version used by the English church in the 5th Psalm is
      subject to the same observation as on the 4th.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church version is
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          Thou in the morn shall hear my voice
        </p>
        <p>
          And with the dawn of day,
        </p>
        <p>
          To thee devoutly I look up,
        </p>
        <p>
          To thee devoutly pray.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Dr. Watts, who gives the Christian meaning of this Psalm,
      translates or paraphrases thus truly:&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          Lord in the morning thou shall hear
        </p>
        <p>
          My voice ascending high,
        </p>
        <p>
          To thee will I direct my pray'r,
        </p>
        <p>
          To thee lift up mine eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up to the hills where Christ is gone
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>To plead for all his Saints</i>,
        </p>
        <p>
          Presenting at his father's throne,
        </p>
        <p>
          Our songs and our complaints.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Psalmody, or the singing of sacred music, conducted by such a
      gracious and animated sense of the revealed word of God, must
      naturally be performed, as it must be ardently felt, in a
      different spirit&mdash;and this truth we perceive daily
      verified; but while a considerable portion of our clergy not
      only are strict in confining the singing to the last
      <i>version</i>, or to parts of Sternhold, and even prescribe
      the very dull old <i>tunes</i> to be made use of, improvement
      in church music is not to be expected. I have before me a
      list of tunes, to which the organists of our churches and
      episcopal chapels are limited in their playing; and, what is
      singular, three of the chief clergymen of the churches
      confess they literally have no ear for music, and are utter
      strangers to what an <i>octave</i> means, and yet their
      <i>authority</i> decides.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not intended to enter into any polemical discussion, as
      controversy is not necessary to the improvement of psalmody;
      but less than has been stated would not have shown the
      advantage to be acquired by the use of a more Christian sense
      to those who rely on Christ as their Redeemer. We know, from
      experience, how agreeable it is to the
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page388" name="page388"></a>[pg
      388]</span> mind and senses to hear the praises to the
      Almighty sung by the proper rules of harmony, and with what
      spiritual animation the upright and sincere youth of both
      sexes unite in this delightful service.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these views, I respectfully submit to the clergymen of
      the new churches to pursue the course which receives such
      universal approbation in St. James's Chapel,
      Mornington-place, Hampstead-road. The simplicity and effect
      must be strong motives to excite their attention, and I hope
      to witness its adoption.

      In the Drama entitled <i>Shakspeare's Early Days</i>, the
      compliment which the poet is made to pay the queen: "That as
      at her birth she wept when all around was joy, so at her
      death she will smile while all around is grief," has been
      admired by the critics. In this jewel-stealing age, it is but
      just to restore the little brilliant to its owner. The
      following lines are in Sir William Jones's Life, translated
      by him from one of the Eastern poets, and are so exquisitely
      beautiful that I think they will be acceptable to some of
      your fair readers for their albums.

      WRECK ON A CORAL REEF.
    </h3>
    <p>
      (<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      I take the liberty of transmitting you an authentic, though
      somewhat concise, narrative of the loss of the Hon. Company's
      regular ship, "Cabalva," (on the Cargados, Carajos, in the
      Indian Seas, in latitude 16&deg; 45 s.) in July, 1818, no
      detailed account having hitherto appeared. The following was
      written by one of the surviving officers, in a letter to a
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      A CONSTANT READER.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hon. Company's ship, Cabalva, having struck on the Owers,
      in the English Channel, and from that circumstance, proving
      leaky, and manifesting great weakness in her frame, it was
      thought advisable to bear up for Bombay in order to dock the
      ship. Meeting with a severe gale of wind off the Cape, (in
      which we made twenty inches of water per hour,) we parted
      from our consort, and shaped a course for Bombay; but on the
      7th of July, between four and five A.M. (the weather dark and
      cloudy) the ship going seven or eight knots, an alarm was
      given of breakers on the larboard bow; the helm was instantly
      put hard-a-port, and the head sheets let go; but before it
      could have the desired effect, she struck; the shock was so
      violent, that every person was instantly on deck, with horror
      and amazement depicted on their countenances. An effort was
      made to get the ship off, but it was immediately seen that
      all endeavours to save her must be useless; she soon became
      fixed, and the sea broke over her with tremendous force;
      stove in her weather side, making a clear
      passage&mdash;washed through the hatchways, tearing up the
      decks, and all that opposed its violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were now uncertain of our distance from a place of safety;
      the surf burst over the vessel in a dreadful cascade, the
      crew despairing and clinging to her sides to avoid its
      violence, while the ship was breaking up with a rapidity and
      crashing noise, which added to the roaring of the breakers,
      drowned the voices of the officers. The masts were cut away
      to ease the ship, and the cutter cleared from the booms and
      launched from the lee-gunwale. When the long wished-for dawn
      at last broke on us, instead of alleviating, it rather added
      to, our distress. We found the ship had run on the
      south-easternmost extremity of a coral reef, surrounding on
      the eastern side those sand-banks or islands in the Indian
      ocean, called Cargados, Carajos: the nearest of these was
      about three miles distant, but not the least appearance of
      verdure could be discovered, or the slightest trace of
      anything on which we might hope to subsist. In two or three
      places some pyramidical rocks appeared above the rest like
      distant sails, and were repeatedly cheered as such by the
      crew, till it was soon perceived they had no motion, and the
      delusion vanished. The masts had fallen towards the reef, the
      ship having fortunately canted in that direction, and the
      boat was thereby protected in some measure from the surf. Our
      commander, whom a strong sense of misfortune had entirely
      deprived of mind so necessary on these occasions, was
      earnestly requested to get into the boat, but he would not,
      thinking her unsafe. He maintained his station on the mizen
      top-mast that lay among the wreck to leeward; the surf which
      was rushing round the bow and stern continually overwhelming
      him. I was myself close to him on the same spar, and in this
      situation we saw many of our shipmates meet an untimely end,
      being either dashed against the rocks or swept over by the
      breakers. The large cutter, full of officers and men, now
      cleared a passage through the mass of wreck, and being
      furnished with oars, watched the proper moment and pushed off
      for the reef, which she fortunately gained in safety; they
      were all washed out of her in an instant by a tremendous
      surf, yet out of more than sixty which it contained, only one
      man was drowned. Our captain seeing this, wished he had taken
      advice, which was now of no use. Finding I could not longer
      maintain myself on the same spar, and seeing the captain in a
      very exhausted state, I solicited him to return to the wreck,
      but he replied, that since we must all eventually perish, I
      should not think of his, but rather of my own, preservation.
      An enormous breaker now burst on us with irresistible force,
      so that I scarcely noticed what occurred to him afterwards,
      being buried by successive seas. At length, after the most
      desperate efforts, I was thrown on the reef, half drowned and
      severely cut by the sharp coral, when I silently offered up
      thanks for my preservation, and crawling up the reef, waved
      my hand to encourage those who remained behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain, however, was not to be seen, and most of the
      others had returned to the wreck and were employed in getting
      the small cutter into the
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page390" name="page390"></a>[pg
      390]</span> water, which they accomplished, and safely
      reached the shore. About noon, when we had all left the ship,
      she was a perfect wreck. The whole of the upper works, from
      the after part of the forecastle to the break of the poop
      deck, had separated from her bottom about the upper
      futtock-heads, and was driving in towards the reef. Most of
      the lighter cargo had floated out of her. Bales of company's
      cloth, cases of wine, puncheons of spirits, barrels of
      gunpowder, hogsheads of beer, &amp;c. lay strewed on the
      shore, together with a chest of tools. Finding the men
      beginning to commit the usual excesses, we stove in the heads
      of the spirit casks, to prevent mischief, and endeavoured to
      direct their attention to the general benefit. The tide was
      flowing fast, and we saw that the reef must soon be covered;
      we therefore conveyed the boats to a place of safety, and
      filling them with all the provisions that could be collected,
      proceeded to the highest sand-bank as the only place which
      held out the remotest chance of security. Our progress was
      attended with the most excruciating pain I ever endured, with
      feet cut to the bones by the rocks, and back blistered by the
      sun&mdash;exhausted with fatigue&mdash;up to the
      waist&mdash;sometimes to the neck in the water, and
      frequently obliged to swim. Seeing, however, that several had
      reached the highest sand-bank, lighted a fire, and were
      employed in erecting a tent from the cloth and small spars
      which had floated up, I felt my spirits revive, and had
      strength sufficient to reach the desired spot, when I was
      invited to partake of a shark which had just been caught by
      the people. Having set a watch to announce the approach of
      the sea, lest it should cover us unawares, I sunk exhausted
      on the sand, and fell into a sound sleep. I awoke in the
      morning stiff with the exertions of the former day, yet
      feeling grateful to Providence that I was still alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people now collected together to ascertain who had
      perished, when sixteen were missing: the captain, surgeon's
      assistant, and fourteen of the crew. We divided the crew into
      parties, each headed by an officer; some were sent to the
      wreck and along the beach in search of provisions, others to
      roll up the hogsheads of beer, and butts of water that had
      floated on shore; but the greater number were employed in
      hauling the two cutters up, when the carpenters were directed
      to repair them.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time it was dark, we had collected about eighty pieces
      of salt pork, ten hogsheads of beer, three butts of water,
      several bottles of wine, and many articles of use and value;
      particularly three sextants and a quadrant, Floresburg's
      <i>Directory</i>, and <i>Hamilton Moore</i>; the latter were
      deemed inestimable. In course of time four live pigs, and
      five live sheep, came on shore through the surf.
    </p>
    <p>
      We first began upon the dead stock, serving out two ounces to
      each, and half a pint of beer for the day. Nothing but
      brackish water could be obtained by digging in the sand. We
      collected all the provisions together near the tent, and
      formed a kind of storehouse, setting an officer to guard them
      from plunder, to which indeed some of the evil characters
      were disposed; but as they were threatened with instant death
      if detected, they were soon deterred. The second night was
      passed like the first, all being huddled together under one
      large tent; the more robust, however, soon began to build
      separate tents for themselves, and divided into messes, as on
      board. A staff was next erected, on which we hoisted a red
      flag, as a signal to any vessel which might be passing. Every
      morning, to each mess, was distributed the allowance of two
      ounces per man, and half a pint of beer; if they got any
      thing else, it was what they could catch by fishing, &amp;c.
      Of fish, indeed, there was a great variety, but we had few
      facilities for catching them, so that upon the whole, we were
      no better than half-starved. The bank on which we lived, was
      in latitude 16&deg; 45 s. and about two miles in
      circumference at low water; the high tides would sometimes
      leave us scarcely half a mile of sand, and often approached
      close to the tents; and if the wind had blown from the
      westward, or shifted only a few points, we must inevitably
      have been swept away, as an encampment of fishermen had been,
      a short time previous from the same spot; however, Providence
      was pleased to preserve us, one hundred and twenty in number,
      to return to our native country.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 13th the largest boat was repaired, and the officers
      thought it advisable to despatch her for relief to the Isle
      of France, distant about four hundred miles. The superior
      officers finding it impossible to leave the crew, dedicated
      the charge of her to the purser. We furnished him with two
      sextants, a navigation book, sails, oars, and log line. Six
      officers and eight men, who perfectly understood the
      management of the boat, joined him. He was directed to run
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page391" name="page391"></a>[pg
      391]</span> first into the latitude, and then bear up for the
      land. On the 17th he arrived at the Mauritius, and on the
      20th returned by his Majesty's vessels, Magician and
      Challenger. On the 21st we were taken on board, after being
      sixteen days on this barren reef, suffering great distress in
      mind and body. We all received the most humane attention from
      the captains of his Majesty's vessels, and on the 28th, we
      reached the Mauritius whence I returned to England.

      MANNERS &amp; CUSTOMS OF ALL NATIONS.

    <h3>
      SINGING OF PSALMS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      This has been a very ancient custom both among the Jews and
      Christians. St. Paul mentions this practice, which has
      continued in all succeeding ages, with some variations as to
      mode and circumstance; for so long as immediate inspiration
      lasted, the preacher, &amp;c. frequently gave out a hymn; and
      when this ceased, proper portions of scripture were selected,
      or agreeable hymns thereto composed; but by the council of
      Laodicea, it was ordered that no private composition should
      be used in church; the council also ordered that the psalms
      should no longer be one continued service, but that proper
      lessons should be interposed to prevent the people being
      tired. At first the whole congregation bore a part, singing
      all together; afterwards the manner was altered, and they
      sung alternately, some repeating one verse, and some another.
      After the emperors became Christians, and persecution ceased,
      singing grew much more into use, so that not only in the
      churches but also in private houses, the ancient music not
      being quite lost, they diversified into various sorts of
      harmony, and altered into soft, strong, gay, sad, grave, or
      passionate, &amp;c. Choice was always made of that which
      agreed with the majesty and purity of religion, avoiding soft
      and effeminate airs; in some churches they ordered the psalms
      to be pronounced with so small an alteration of voice, that
      it was little more than plain speaking, like the reading of
      psalms in our cathedrals, &amp;c. at this day; but in process
      of time, instrumental music was introduced first amongst the
      Greeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pope Gregory the Great refined upon the church music and made
      it more exact and harmonious; and that it might be general,
      he established singing schools at Rome, wherein persons were
      educated to be sent to the distant churches, and where it has
      remained ever since; only among the reformed there are
      various ways of performing, and even in the same church,
      particularly that of England, in which parish churches differ
      much from cathedrals; but most dissenters comply with this
      part of worship in some form or other.

      title, allow me to observe, that it appears to me that it
      originated from a skimmer being always used (as I have heard
      from very good authority it is) as the leading instrument
      towards making the various sounds usual on such occasions. I
      think it, therefore, very probable it took its rise from the
      utensil skimmer, and would be more properly called
      Skimmerting Riding.

      ANCIENT SUPERSTITION RESPECTING FELLING OAKS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the <i>Magna Britannia</i>, the author in his <i>Account
      of the Hundred of Croydon</i>, says, "Our historians take
      notice of two things in this parish, which may not be
      convenient to us to omit, viz. a great wood called Norwood,
      belonging to the archbishops, wherein was anciently a tree
      called the vicar's oak, where four parishes met, as it were
      in a point. It is said to have consisted wholly of oaks, and
      among them was one that bore mistletoe, which some persons
      were so hardy as to cut for the gain of selling it to the
      apothecaries of London, leaving a branch of it to sprout out;
      but they proved unfortunate after it, for one of them fell
      lame, and others lost an eye. At length in the year 1678, a
      certain man, notwithstanding he was warned against it, upon
      the account of what the others had suffered, adventured to
      cut the tree down, and he soon after broke his leg. To fell
      oaks hath <span class="pagenum"><a id="page392"
      name="page392"></a>[pg 392]</span> long been counted fatal,
      and such as believe it produce the instance of the Earl of
      Winchelsea, who having felled a curious grove of oaks, soon
      after found his countess dead in her bed suddenly, and his
      eldest son, the Lord Maidstone, was killed at sea by a cannon
      ball."

      THE MODERN GREEKS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Have preserved dances in honour of Flora. The wives and
      maidens of the village gather and scatter flowers, and bedeck
      themselves from head to foot. She who leads the dance, more
      ornamented than the others, represents Flora and the Spring,
      whose return the hymn they sing announces; one of them
      sings&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>
          "Welcome sweet nymph,
        </p>
        <p>
          Goddess of the month of May."
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      In the Grecian villages, and among the Bulgarians, they still
      observe the feast of Ceres. When harvest is almost ripe, they
      go dancing to the sound of the lyre, and visit the fields,
      whence they return with their heads ornamented with wheat
      ears, interwoven with the hair. Embroidering is the
      occupation of the Grecian women; to the Greeks we owe this
      art, which is exceedingly ancient among them, and has been
      carried to the highest degree of perfection. Enter the
      chamber of a Grecian girl, and you will see blinds at the
      window, and no other furniture than a sofa, and a chest
      inlaid with ivory, in which are kept silk, needles, and
      articles for embroidery. Apologues, tales, and romances, owe
      their origin to Greece. The modern Greeks love tales and
      fables, and have received them from the Orientals and Arabs,
      with as much eagerness as they formerly adopted them from the
      Egyptians. The old women love always to relate, and the young
      pique themselves on repeating those they have learnt, or can
      make, from such incidents as happen within their knowledge.
      The Greeks at present have no fixed time for the celebration
      of marriages, like the ancients; among whom the ceremony was
      performed in the month of January. Formerly the bride was
      bought by real services done to the father; which was
      afterwards reduced to presents, and to this time the custom
      is continued, though the presents are arbitrary. The man is
      not obliged to purchase the woman he marries, but, on the
      contrary, receives a portion with her equal to her condition.
      It is on the famous shield of Achilles that Homer has
      described a marriage procession&mdash;
    </p>
    <div class="poem">

      POPE.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same pomp, procession, and music, are still in use.
      Dancers, musicians, and singers, who chant the Epithalamium,
      go before the bride; loaded with ornaments, her eyes
      downcast, and herself sustained by women, or two near
      relations, she walks extremely slow. Formerly the bride wore
      a red or yellow veil. The Arminians do so still; this was to
      hide the blush of modesty, the embarrassment, and the tears
      of the young virgin. The bright torch of Hymen is not
      forgotten among the modern Greeks. It is carried before the
      new married couple into the nuptial chamber, where it burns
      till it is consumed, and it would be an ill omen were it by
      any accident extinguished, wherefore it is watched with as
      much care as of old was the sacred fire of the vestals.
      Arrived at the church, the bride and bridegroom each wear a
      crown, which, during the ceremony, the priest changes, by
      giving the crown of the bridegroom to the bride, and that of
      the bride to the bridegroom, which custom is also derived
      from the ancients.
    </p>
    <p>
      I must not forget an essential ceremony which the Greeks have
      preserved, which is the cup of wine given to the bridegroom
      as a token of adoption; it was the symbol of contract and
      alliance. The bride drank from the same cup, which afterwards
      passed round to the relations and guests. They dance and sing
      all night, but the companions of the bride are
      excluded&mdash;they feast among themselves in separate
      apartments, far from the tumult of the nuptials. The modern
      Greeks, like the ancient, on the nuptial day, decorate their
      doors with green branches and garlands of flowers.

    <center>
      <i>Sir Richard Phillips's Personal Tour, Part III</i>.
    </center>
    <p>
      Our extracts from the previous portion of this work, have
      forcibly illustrated the striking originality of its style,
      and the interesting character of its information.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present Part concludes Newstead, and includes Mansfield,
      Chesterfield, Dronfield, Sheffield, Rotherham, and Barnsley;
      and from it we extract the following facts, which almost form
      a <i>picture of Sheffield</i>.<a id="footnotetag2"
      name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      "The drive from Dronfield to Sheffield is pleasant and
      picturesque. It is the dawn of a region of high hills, a fine
      range of which stretch westward into Derbyshire, while on
      every side there are lofty eminences and deep valleys.
      Sheffield opens magnificently on the right, and its villas
      and ornamented suburbs stretch full two miles on the
      eminences to the left. At two or three miles from Sheffield,
      the western suburbs display a rich and pleasing variety of
      villas and country-houses. On the left, the Dore-moors, a
      ridge of barren hills, stretch to an indefinite distance: and
      on the right, some high hills skreen from sight the town of
      Sheffield. At a mile distant, the view to the right opens,
      and from a rise in the road is beheld the fine amphitheatre
      of Sheffield; the sun displaying its entire extent, and the
      town being surmounted by fine hills in the rear. The wind
      carried the smoke to the east of the town, and the sun in the
      meridian presented as fine a <i>coup d'oeil</i> as can be
      conceived. The approach was by a broad and well-built street,
      the population were in activity, and I entered a celebrated
      place with many agreeable expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sheffield is within the bounds of Yorkshire, but on the
      verge of Derbyshire, and was the most remarkable place and
      society of human beings which I had yet seen. It stands in
      one of the most picturesque situations that can be imagined,
      originally at the south end of a valley surrounded by high
      hills, but now extended around the western hill; the first as
      a compact town, and the latter as scattered villas and houses
      on the same hill, to the distance of two miles from the
      ancient site. It is connected with London by Nottingham and
      Derby, and distant from Leeds 33 miles, and York 54 miles.
      Its foundation was at the junction of two rivers, the Sheaf
      and the Don; in the angle formed by which once stood the
      Castle, built by the, Barons Furnival, Lords of Hallamshire;
      but subsequently in the tenure of the Talbots, Earls of
      Shrewsbury. Three or four miles from this Castle, on the
      western hill, stood the Saxon town of <i>Hallam</i>, said to
      have been destroyed by the Norman invaders, on account of
      their gallant opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The town was originally a mere village, dependant on the
      Castle; but its mineral and subterranean wealth led the early
      inhabitants to become manufacturers of edged tools, of which
      arrow heads, spear heads, &amp;c. are presumed to have been a
      considerable part; a bundle of arrows being at this day in
      the town arms, and cross arrows the badge of the ancient
      Cutlers' Company of Sheffield.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The exhaustless coal seams and iron-stone beds in the
      vicinity, combined with the ingenuity of the people,
      conferred early fame on their products; for Chaucer, in
      alluding to a knife, calls it 'a Sheffield
      thwittel,'&mdash;whittle being among the manufacturers at
      this day the name of a common kind of knife.
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page394" name="page394"></a>[pg
      394]</span> The increasing demand for articles of cutlery,
      and their multiplied variety have gradually enlarged the
      population of Sheffield to 42,157 in 1821; since which it has
      considerably increased, and may, in 1829, be estimated at
      50,000. In 1821, it contained 8,726 houses, and perhaps 500
      have been built since, chiefly villas to the westward, while
      the compact town is about one mile by half a mile. The
      principal streets are well built, and there are three old
      churches, and two new ones lately finished, besides another
      now building.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sheffield presents at this time the extraordinary spectacle
      of an immense town expanded from a village, without any
      additional arrangements for its government beyond what it
      originally possessed as a village. There is no corporation,
      not even a resident magistrate, and yet all live in peace,
      decorum, and advantageous mutual intercourse."
    </p>
    <center>
      <i>Religion.</i>
    </center>
    <p>
      "Order is a moral result of religion in Sheffield. No town in
      the kingdom more universally exhibits the external forms of
      devotion, and in none are there perhaps a greater number of
      serious devotees. The largest erections in Sheffield are
      those for the service of religion, and they are numerous.
      Besides six old and new churches, adapted to accommodate from
      10,000 to 12,000 persons, there are seventeen chapels for the
      various denominations of Dissenters, capable of affording
      sitting room for 12,000 or 15,000 more. Except the Unitarian
      Chapel, and perhaps the Catholic one, the doctrines preached
      in all the others, are what, in London, and at Oxford and
      Cambridge, would generally be called <i>Ultra</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A spectacle highly characteristic of Sheffield, and
      exemplifying, at the same time the harmony of the several
      sects, is the juxtaposition of four several chapels,
      observable on one side of a main street; while nearly
      adjoining is the church of St. Paul. There are thus every
      Sunday, in simultaneous local devotion, the ceremonial
      Catholics, the moral Unitarians, the metaphysical Calvinists,
      the serious disciples of John Wesley, and the spiritual
      members of the establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The whole of the places of worship afford accommodation for
      about 12,000 Methodists and Dissenters, and about 9,500 of
      the Church Establishment. So that, if half go twice a day,
      and half once, 30,000 of the 50,000 inhabitants attend places
      of worship every Sunday."

      <i>Public Institutions.</i>

    <p>
      "There are the following institutions for the promotion of
      knowledge and science:&mdash;

    <p>
      "1. A Permanent Library supported by the subscriptions of 270
      members at one guinea each, and four guineas admission. The
      books are numerous; but, contrary to the practice of other
      similar institutions, books of Theology, and the trash of
      modern Novels, are introduced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "2. A Literary and Philosophical Society for lectures, and
      the purchase of apparatus, now very complete, supported by 80
      proprietors, at two guineas, besides a still greater number
      of subscribers at one guinea per annum.

    <p>
      "3. Two News-rooms, in which the London and Provincial papers
      may be read.

    <p>
      "4. A Public Concert, supported by subscriptions, which
      amount to &pound;700 per annum, and of which Mr. Fritch, from
      Derby, is the present leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      "5. A Subscription Assembly held through the winter, but ill
      supported.

    <p>
      "6. A Shakspeare Club, for sustaining the drama, consisting
      of 80 members, who subscribe a guinea per annum, once a-year
      bespeak a play, and partake of a dinner, to which the sons of
      Thespis are invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "7. An Infirmary on a large scale, and munificently
      supported.
    </p>

      "8. Two Schools, in which sixty boys and sixty girls are
      clothed, fed, and educated.

      "9. A Lancasterian and a National School well supported, and
      numerously attended.

      "10. Sunday Schools attached to the twenty-three
      congregations, besides others.

    <p>
      "11. A Society for Bettering the Condition of the Poor, in
      much activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "12. Dorcas' Societies, connected with the churches and
      chapels, to assist poor married women during child-birth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "13. A Bible Society on the usual plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "14. Two Medical and Anatomical Schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      "15. A thriving Mechanics' Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Several of these institutions rendezvous in a spacious
      building called the Music Hall. The concerts are given in the
      upper room, a suitable saloon; and beneath are the
      Subscription Library, the Commercial News-room, and the
      Museum of the Literary and Philosophical Society."

      <i>Manufactures.</i>
    </center>
    <p>
      "The staple manufactures of Sheffield embrace the metallic
      arts in all their varieties. The chief articles are sharp
      instruments, as knives, scissors, razors, saws, and
      edge-tools of various kinds, and to these may be added, files
      and plated goods to a great extent, besides stove-grates and
      fenders of exquisite beauty. It is altogether performed by
      hand, therefore the fabrication may always be rendered
      correspondent with the demand, and may be arrested when the
      demand ceases. This confers a definite advantage on the
      manufactory, not enjoyed by other trades which operate in the
      large way. The result is mediocrity of wealth, and little
      ruinous speculation. At the same time, the sanguine
      expectations of manufacturers often lead them to overstock
      themselves, and as the demand has been, so they expect it
      always to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sheffield employs about 15,000 persons in its various
      branches, and of these full one-third are engaged on knives
      and forks, pocket-knives, razors, and scissors. The rest are
      engaged in the plated trades, in saws, files, and some fancy
      trades. The following is an exact enumeration of the hands

      &amp;c., making full 5,000 more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are full 1,700 forges engaged in the various branches
      of the trades, and of course as many fires, fixing oxygen to
      make their heat, and evolving the undecomposed carbon in
      active volumes of steam and smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The place is usually described as smoky, but I thought it
      less so than the central parts of London. The manufactures,
      for the most part, are carried on in an unostentatious way,
      in small scattered shops, and no where make the noise and
      bustle of a single great iron works. Compared with them
      Sheffield is a seat of elegant arts, nevertheless compared
      with the cotton and silk trades, it must be regarded as dirty
      and smoky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The steel and plated manufactures require much taste, and in
      some cases make a great display. Hence there were exhibitions
      of elegant products, not exceeded in the Palais Royal, or any
      other place abroad, and superior to any of the cutlers' shops
      in London. All that the lustre of steel ware and silver plate
      can produce, is, in Sheffield, exhibited in splendid
      arrangement, in the warerooms of some of the principal
      manufacturers. In particular Messrs. J. Rodgers and Sons,
      cutlers to his Majesty, display in a magnificent saloon, all
      the multiplied elegant products of their own most ingenious
      manufactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As proofs of their power of manufacturing, Messrs. Rodgers
      have, in their show-rooms the most extraordinary products of
      highly finished manufacture which are to be seen in the
      world. Among them are the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "1. An arrangement in a Maltese cross about 18 inches high,
      and 10 inches broad, which developes 1,821 blades and
      different instruments; worthy of a royal cabinet, but in the
      best situation in the place which produced it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "2. A knife which unfolds 200 blades for various purposes,
      matchless in workmanship, and a wonderful display of
      ingenuity. Its counterpart was presented to the King; and
      that in possession of Messrs. Rodgers, is offered at 200
      guineas, and is worthy of some imperial cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "3. A knife containing 75 blades, not a mere curiosity, but a
      package of instruments of real utility in the compass of a
      knife 4 inches long, 3 inches high, and 1-1/4 inches broad.
      It is valued at 50 guineas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "4. A miniature knife, enfolding 75 articles, which weigh but
      7 dwts., exquisitely wrought and valued at 50 guineas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "5. A common quill, containing 24 dozen of scissors, perfect
      in form, and made of polished steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are kept as trophies of skill, in the perfect
      execution of which, the manufacturer considers that he
      displays his power of producing any useful articles of which
      the Sheffield manufacture consists. Mr. Rodgers obligingly
      conducted me through his various workshops, and I discovered
      that the perfection of the Sheffield manufacture arises from
      the judicious division of labour. I saw knives, razors,
      &amp;c. &amp;c., produced in a few minutes from the raw
      material. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page396"
      name="page396"></a>[pg 396]</span> I saw dinner knives made
      from the steel bar and all the process of hammering it into
      form, welding the tang of the handle to the steel of the
      blade, hardening the metal by cooling it in water and
      tempering it by de-carbonizing it in the fire with a rapidity
      and facility that were astonishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The number of hands through which a common table knife
      passes in its formation is worthy of being known to all who
      use them. The bar steel is heated in the forge by <i>the
      maker</i>, and he and <i>the striker</i> reduce it in a few
      minutes into the shape of a knife. He then heats a bar of
      iron and welds it to the steel so as to form the tang of the
      blade which goes into the handle. All this is done with the
      simplest tools and contrivances. A few strokes of the hammer
      in connexion with some trifling moulds and measures, attached
      to the anvil, perfect, in two or three minutes the blade and
      its tang or shank. Two men, the maker and striker, produce
      about nine blades in an hour, or seven dozen and a half per
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The rough blade thus produced then passes through the hands
      of <i>the filer</i>, who files the blade into form by means
      of a pattern in hard steel. It then goes to the halters to be
      hafted in ivory, horn, &amp;c. as may be required; it next
      proceeds to the finisher, to Mr. Rodgers for examination, and
      is then packed for sale or exportation. In this progression
      every table-knife, pocket-knife, or pen-knife, passes step by
      step, through no less than sixteen hands, involving in the
      language of Mr. Rodgers, at least 144 separate stages of
      workmanship in the production of a single pen-knife. The
      prices vary from 2<i>s</i>. 6<i>d</i>. per dozen knives and
      forks, to &pound;10."

      MODE OF DESTROYING EAGLES.
    </h3>
    <p>
      In those parts of the Highlands of Scotland where eagles are
      numerous, and where they commit great ravages among the young
      lambs, the following methods are used for destroying
      them:&mdash;When the nest happens to be in a place situated
      in the direction of a perpendicular from the edge of a cliff
      above, a bundle of dry heath or grass inclosing a burning
      peat is let down into it. In other cases, a person is let
      down by means of a rope, which is held above by four or five
      men, and contrives to destroy the eggs or young. The person
      who thus descends takes a large stick with him, to beat off
      or intimidate the old eagles. The latter, however, always
      keep at a respectable distance, for powerful as they are,
      they possess little of the courage which has in all ages been
      attributed to them, being in this respect much inferior to
      the domestic cock, the raven, the sea-swallow, and a hundred
      other birds. Sometimes eagles have their nests in places
      accessible without a rope, and instances are known of persons
      frequenting these nests, for the purpose of carrying off the
      prey which the eagles carry to their young. A very prevalent
      method by which eagles are destroyed, is the
      following:&mdash;In a place not far from a nest, or a rock in
      which eagles repose at night, or on the face of a hill which
      they are frequently observed to scour in search of prey, a
      pit is dug to the depth of a few feet, of sufficient size to
      admit a man with ease. The pit is then covered over with
      sticks, and pieces of turf, the latter not cut from the
      vicinity, eagles, like other cowards, being extremely wary
      and suspicious. A small hole is formed at one end of this
      pit, through which projects the muzzle of a gun, while at the
      other is left an opening large enough to admit a featherless
      biped, who on getting in pulls after him a bundle of heath of
      sufficient size to close it. A carcass of a sheep or dog, or
      a fish or fowl, being previously without at the distance of
      from twelve to twenty yards, the lyer-in-wait watches
      patiently for the descent of the eagle, and, the moment it
      has fairly settled upon the carrion, fires. In this manner,
      multitudes of eagles are yearly destroyed in Scotland. The
      head, claws, and quills, are kept by the shepherds, to be
      presented to the factor at Martinmas or Whitsunday, for the
      premium of from half-a-crown to five shillings which is
      usually awarded on-such occasions.&mdash;<i>Edinburgh

      THE PIED OYSTER CATCHER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      This separate and single genus of birds is seldom seen
      amongst the numerous descriptions of wild fowl, which, in the
      winter seasons, wing their flight to our marshes. The most
      striking part of the Oyster-catcher is its bill, the colour
      of which is scarlet, measuring in length nearly four inches,
      wide at the nostrils, and grooved beyond them nearly half its
      length: thence to the tip it is vertically compressed on the
      sides, and ends obtusely. With this instrument, which in its
      shape and structure is peculiar to this bird, it easily
      disengages the limpets from the rocks, and plucks out the
      oysters from their half-opened shells, on which it feeds, as
      well as on other shell-fish, sea-worms, and insects.

      BUTTERFLIES.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The splendid appearance of the plumage of tropical birds is
      not superior to what the curious observer may discover in a
      variety of Lepid&oacute;ptera; and those many-coloured eyes,
      which deck so gorgeously the peacock's tail, are imitated
      with success in Van&eacute;ssa Io, one of our most common
      butterflies. "See," exclaims the illustrious Linnaeus, "the
      large, elegant, painted wings of the butterfly,
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page398" name="page398"></a>[pg
      398]</span> four in number, covered with small imbricated
      scales; with these it sustains itself in the air the whole
      day, rivalling the flight of birds, and the brilliancy of the
      peacock. Consider this insect through the wonderful progress
      of its life, how different is the first period of its being
      from the second, and both from the parent insect. Its changes
      are an inexplicable enigma to us: we see a green caterpillar,
      furnished with sixteen feet, creeping, hairy, and feeding
      upon the leaves of a plant; this is changed into chrysalis,
      smooth, of a golden lustre, hanging suspended to a fixed
      point, without feet, and subsisting without food; this insect
      again undergoes another transformation, acquires wings and
      six feet, and becomes a variegated white butterfly, living by
      suction upon the honey of plants. What has nature produced
      more worthy of our admiration? Such an animal coming upon the
      stage of the world, and playing its part there under so many
      different masks! In the egg of the Papilio, the epidermis or
      external integument falling off, a caterpillar is disclosed;
      the second epidermis drying, and being detached, it is a
      chrysalis; and the third, a butterfly. It should seem that
      the ancients were so struck with the transformations of the
      butterfly, and its revival from a seeming temporary death, as
      to have considered it an emblem of the soul, the Greek word
      <i>psyche</i> signifying both the soul and a butterfly. This
      is also confirmed by their allegorical sculptures, in which
      the butterfly occurs as an emblem of immortality."
      Swammerdam, speaking of the metamorphosis of insects, uses
      these strong words: "This process is formed in so remarkable
      a manner in butterflies, that we see therein the resurrection
      painted before our eyes, and exemplified so as to be examined
      by our hands." "There is no one," says Paley, "who does not
      possess some particular train of thought, to which the mind
      naturally directs itself, when left entirely to its own
      operations. It is certain too, that the choice of this train
      of thinking may be directed to different ends, and may appear
      to be more or less judiciously fixed, but in a <i>moral
      view</i>, if one train of thinking be more desirable than
      another, it is that which regards phenomena of nature with a
      constant reference to a supreme intelligent Author. The works
      of nature want only to be contemplated. In every portion of
      them which we can decry, we find attention bestowed upon the
      minuter objects. Every organized natural body, in the
      provisions which it contains for its sustentation and
      propagation, testifies a care, on the part of the Creator,
      expressly directed to these purposes. We are on all sides
      surrounded by bodies wonderfully curious, and no less
      wonderfully diversified." Trifling, therefore, and, perhaps,
      contemptible, as to the unthinking may seem the study of a
      butterfly, yet, when we consider the art and mechanism
      displayed in so minute a structure, the fluids circulating in
      vessels so small as almost to escape the sight, the beauty of
      the wings and covering, and the manner in which each part is
      adapted for its peculiar functions, we cannot but be struck
      with wonder and admiration, and must feel convinced that the
      maker of all has bestowed equal skill in every class of
      animated beings; and also allow with Paley, that "the
      production of beauty was as much in the Creator's mind in
      painting a butterfly, as in giving symmetry to the human
      form."

      LADY MORGAN'S EGOTISM.
    </h3>
    <p>
      We know, and posterity will say the same, that there was
      never such a paragon as her ladyship; that her house in
      Kildare-street, Dublin, will be to future ages, what
      Shakspeare's house in Henley-street, Stratford-upon-Avon, is
      now; that pilgrims from all corners of the civilized globe
      will pay their devotions at her shrine; and that the name of
      Morgan will be remembered long after the language in which
      she has immortalized it has ceased to be a living tongue. WE
      are not the persons to deny this; for WE are but too proud of
      being able to call ourselves her contemporary; but we do
      dislike (and her ladyship will, forgive us for saying
      so)&mdash;we do dislike the seeming vanity of proclaiming
      this herself. She <i>is</i> a very great woman; an
      extraordinary woman; an Irish prodigy; popes and emperors
      <i>have</i> trembled before her; all Europe, all Asia, all
      America, from the St. Lawrence to the Gulf of Mexico, ring
      with her praises; there never has been such "a jewel of a
      woman," as her own countrymen would say. She knows this, and
      we know it; and "our husband" knows it; every body knows it;
      then why need she tell us so a hundred times over in her
      "Book of the Boudoir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another little circumstance which we would take the
      liberty of mentioning. It is, that she is much too
      scrupulous, much too delicate in naming
      <span class="pagenum"><a id="page399" name="page399"></a>[pg
      399]</span> individuals, <i>unless they happen to be
      dead</i>. When she mentions a civil thing said to her by a
      prince, a duke, or a marquess, we never get at the
      <i>person</i>. It is always the Prince of A&mdash;&mdash;, or
      the Duke of B&mdash;&mdash;, or the Marquess of
      C&mdash;&mdash;, or Count D&mdash;&mdash;, or Lady
      E&mdash;&mdash;, or the Marchioness of F&mdash;&mdash;, or
      the Countess of G&mdash;&mdash;, or Lord H&mdash;&mdash;, or
      Sir George I&mdash;&mdash;, and so on through the alphabet.
      Now we say again, that <i>we</i> have no doubt all these are
      the initials of real persons, and that her ladyship is as
      familiar with the blood royal and the aristocracy of Europe,
      as "maids of fifteen are with puppy-dogs;" but the world, my
      dear Lady Morgan&mdash;an ill-natured, sour, cynical, and
      suspicious world, envious of your glory, will be apt to call
      it nil fudge, blarney, or <i>blatherum-skite</i>, as they say
      in your country; especially when it is observed that you
      <i>always</i> give the names of the illustrious <i>dead</i>,
      with whom you have been upon equally familiar terms of
      intimacy, at <i>full length</i>; as if you knew that dead
      people tell <i>no</i> tales; and that therefore you might
      tell <i>any</i> tales you like about dead people. We put it
      to your own good sense, my dear Lady Morgan, as the Duke of
      X&mdash;&mdash; would call you, whether this remarkable
      difference in mentioning living characters, and those who are
      no longer living, does not look equivocal? For you know, my
      dear Lady Morgan, that Prince R&mdash;&mdash; and Princess
      W&mdash;&mdash;, by standing for any body, mean
      nobody.&mdash;<i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>.

      CURE FOR SUPERSTITION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      We find the following curious anecdote translated from a
      German work, in the last <i>Foreign Quarterly
      Review</i>:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A poor protestant who had fallen from his horse and done
      himself some serious injury which had obviously ended in
      derangement, came to a Catholic priest, declaring that he was
      possessed, and telling a story of almost dramatic interest.
      In his sickness he had consulted a quack doctor, who told him
      that he could cure him by charms. He wrote strange signs on
      little fragments of paper, some of which were to be worn,
      some to be eaten in bread and drunk in wine. These the poor
      madman fancied afterwards were charms by which he had
      unknowingly sold himself to the devil. The doctor, he
      fancied, had done so before, and could only redeem his own
      soul by putting another in the power of Satan. "I know that
      this is my condition," said the poor madman, "by all I have
      seen and heard, by all I have suffered, by the change which
      has taken place in me, which has at length brought me to my
      present condition. All I cannot reveal; the little I can and
      dare tell must convince you. Often has my tormentor pent me
      up in the stove, and let me lie among the burning brands
      through the live long night. Then I hear him in my torment
      talking loud, I know not what, over my head. All prayer he
      forbids me, and he makes me tell whether I would give all I
      have or my soul for my cure. Then he speaks to me of the
      Bible; but he falsifies all he tells me of, or he tells me of
      some new-born king or queen in the kingdom of God. I cannot
      go to church; I cannot pray; I cannot think a good thought; I
      see sights of horror ever before me, which fill me with
      unutterable fear, and I know not what is rest; my one only
      thought is how soon the devil will come to claim his wretched
      victim and carry me to the place of torment." The poor
      creature had a belief that a Roman Catholic priest had the
      power of exorcism. The priest was most kind to the poor
      maniac, and tried to convince him of the power and goodness
      of God, and his love to his creatures. It need not be said
      that this was talking to the wind. In fine, he said, "Well, I
      will rid you of your tormentor. He shall have to do with me,
      and not with you, in future." This promise had the desired
      effect; and the priest followed it up by advising the maniac
      to go to a good physician, to avoid solitude, to work hard,
      to read his Bible, and remember the comfortable declarations
      of which he had been just reminded, and if he was in any
      doubt or anxiety, to go to his parish minister.

      ADDISON.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A certain author was introduced one day by a friend to Mr.
      Addison, who requested him at the same time to peruse and
      correct a copy of English verses. Addison took the verses and
      found them afterwards very stupid. Observing that above
      twelve lines from Homer were prefixed to them, by way of
      motto, he only erased the Greek lines, without making any
      amendment in the poem, and returned it. The author, seeing
      this, desired his friend who had introduced him to inquire of
      Mr. Addison the reason of his doing so. "Whilst the statues
      of Caligula," said he, "were all of a piece, they were little
      regarded by <span class="pagenum"><a id="page400"
      name="page400"></a>[pg 400]</span> the people, but when he
      fixed the heads of gods upon unworthy shoulders, he profaned
      them, and made himself ridiculous. I, therefore, made no more
      conscience to separate Homer's verses from this poem, than
      the thief did who stole the silver head from the brazen body
      in Westminster Abbey."<a id="footnotetag3"

      In <i>Time's Telescope</i> for 1825, we are told that the few

      To this Shakspeare alludes in the first part of <i>King Henry

      <i>Falstaff</i>, "Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell,
      All-hallowen summer!" And in the first part of <i>King Henry

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
